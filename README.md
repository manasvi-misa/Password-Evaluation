#  Task 6: Password Strength Evaluation

##  Objective
To understand what makes a password strong by creating various passwords, testing them using online tools, and studying common password attack methods.

---

##  Steps Performed

1. Created 3 sample passwords with different complexities:
   - Simple (numeric only)
   - Medium (name + digits)
   - Strong (randomized string)

2. Tested each password on [PasswordMeter](https://passwordmeter.com) to evaluate their strength.

3. Recorded scores, tool feedback, and identified security weaknesses.

4. Studied common password attacks:
   - Brute Force
   - Dictionary Attack
   - Credential Stuffing
   - Phishing
   - Keylogging

5. Mapped tested passwords against the types of attacks they are vulnerable to.

6. Wrote a report summarizing:
   - Password strength results
   - Analysis of attack vectors
   - Best practices for secure password creation

##  Password & Attack Comparison

| Password         | Score | Vulnerable To                            |
|------------------|-------|------------------------------------------|
| 122333444        | 0%    | Brute Force, Dictionary Attack           |
| Manasvi2025      | 87%   | Credential Stuffing, Targeted Guessing   |
| G!Tm#71!svP@9    | 100%  | Not vulnerable to standard attack types  |

##  Key Takeaways

- **Length + randomness** greatly improve security.
- Avoid using names, patterns, or common words.
- **Use password managers** and **enable MFA** wherever possible.
- Never reuse passwords across websites.
